In Alien Invasion, the player contols a rocket ship that appears at the bottom
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left ysing the arrow
keys and shoot bullets using  the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of
aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or
reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses
three ships, the game ends.
